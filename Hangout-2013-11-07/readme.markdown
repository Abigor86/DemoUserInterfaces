# Hangout 7th Nov, 2013
The GUI Files in this demo were created at the request of attendees of a Google Hangout. To be kept up to date for future Google Hangouts, make sure to follow [CommandFusion on Google+](https://plus.google.com/116759659677519116739)

## TV Guide
There is a sample TV Guide project, which demonstrates how to create a dynamically sized group of buttons to represent a TV Guide interface, with each button width representing the length of the show, and multiple channels being presented in a vertical list.

The demo includes samples on loading dynamic XML TV Guide data from timefor.tv using [their sample feed](http://en.timefor.tv/xmltv) (subscription required to use their real data).

The TV Guide demo is lacking a lot of features to be useful, but it's a great starting point to working with GUI objects (resizing and arranging them) dynamically.

## HDMI Switcher
There is a demo of how to process feedback from a SnapAV HDMI matrix switcher, to show output routing in real time.
